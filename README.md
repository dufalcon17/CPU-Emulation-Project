# CPU-Emulation-Project
Portfolio project for CodeCademy
I coded the project using python in Visual Studio Code.
The aim of this project was to emulate a CPU and I designed my project to handle some simple arithmatic.
This CPU takes instructions that are 32 bits in length and stores the results into the memory and the values to make it into the registers.
Aside from doing calculations, the user can retrieve the prievious calculation from the memory and print it to the terminal.
